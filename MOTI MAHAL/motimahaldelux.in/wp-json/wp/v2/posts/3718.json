The evolution of probability theory from the late 1400s was imputed to betting; when playing a game with high stakes, players wanted to know what the chance of winning would be. In 1494, Fra Luca Paccioli introduced his work Summa de arithmetica, geometria, proportioni e proportionalita that was the first written text on chance. Motivated by Paccioli&#8217;s work, Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576) made further improvements in probability theory. His job from 1550, titled Liber de Ludo Aleae, discussed the concepts of probability and the way they were directly related to gaming. His work didn&#8217;t get any recognition that is instant since it wasn&#8217;t published until after his death. Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) also contributed to probability theory. His buddy, Chevalier de M??r??, was an avid gambler with the goal to become wealthy from it. De M??r?? tried a new mathematical approach into a gaming game but did not get the desired results. Determined to understand why his strategy was ineffective, he consulted with Pascal. Pascal&#8217;s work with this problem began a significant correspondence between him and fellow mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665). Communication through letters, both continued to exchange their ideas and ideas. These interactions resulted in probability theory&#8217;s conception. To this day, many gamblers still trust the basic notions of probability theory so as to make informed decisions while betting.<br \/>\nThe following chart enumerates that the (absolute) frequency of every hand, provided all mixtures of 5 cards randomly drawn from a full deck of 52 without replacement.
